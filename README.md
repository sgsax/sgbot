sgbot
=====

Collection of scripts used by an irssi-based IRC bot.

They belong in your `$IRSSIHOME/scripts` dir for you to load and unload as you see fit. If you want them to start automagically when irssi starts up, put symlinks to them in your `$IRSSIHOME/scripts/autorun` dir.

Some require specific perl modules. You'll need to look at the `use` statements in each and install them as appropriate on your system.

You'll notice that these are mostly fairly primitive. They're pretty much quick-and-dirty solutions to silly problems. I'm OK with that, you should be too.
